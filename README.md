---

## 🔥 Live Demo

Explore the app live here:
[https://stakehive-defi-dapp.netlify.app/](https://stakehive-defi-dapp.netlify.app/)

StakeHive is a decentralized finance (DeFi) app enabling users to stake custom HIVE tokens, earn rewards, claim, withdraw, and transfer tokens securely on the blockchain.

---

## 🧪 How to Use StakeHive

Want to start staking with StakeHive? Follow these simple steps:

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Enable Test Networks in MetaMask

By default, MetaMask hides test networks. To enable them:

1. Open **MetaMask**.
2. Click on your **account icon** → **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Advanced**.
4. Scroll to **Show test networks** and **toggle it ON**.
5. Return to the main screen, and you’ll now see **Sepolia** in the network dropdown.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Add Sepolia Testnet (If Not Visible)

If Sepolia isn’t showing:

1. Click **"Select Network"** → **"Add network"** → **"Add network manually"**.

2. Fill in the following:

   ```
   Network Name: Sepolia Test Network
   RPC URL: https://rpc.sepolia.org
   Chain ID: 11155111
   Currency Symbol: ETH
   Block Explorer URL: https://sepolia.etherscan.io
   ```

3. Click **Save**.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Get Sepolia ETH for Gas

You’ll need Sepolia ETH to pay for gas fees. Use one of the following faucets:

- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- [Chainlink Sepolia Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
- [Google Cloude Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)

Paste your MetaMask wallet address and request test ETH.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Add HIVE Token to MetaMask

To see your HIVE token in MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask → go to **Assets** → click **Import tokens**.

2. Enter your deployed token details:

   ```
   Token Contract Address: 0xBA6D102E57Bda979B68BC4c0c47980CeBeF9075b
   Token Symbol: HIVE
   Decimals: 18
   ```

3. Click **Add Custom Token** → **Import Tokens**.

You’ll now see your HIVE balance.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Connect Wallet to StakeHive

1. Visit the live app: [https://stakehive-defi-dapp.netlify.app](https://stakehive-defi-dapp.netlify.app)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**.
3. Choose MetaMask or another supported wallet via **Web3Modal**.

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally and test your own deployment:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Darahat/stakehive-dapp.git
cd stakehive-dapp

# 2. Install dependencies for backend and frontend
npm install
cd frontend && npm install

# 3. Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Sepolia RPC URL and wallet PRIVATE_KEY

# 4. Start the local blockchain and deploy contracts
npx hardhat node &
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# 5. Run the frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Usage Notes

- **Wallet Connection**: MetaMask or compatible wallets are required. If MetaMask is not detected, the app prompts with a styled popup to install it.
- **Token Balances**: The HIVE token balance is shown dynamically, fetched from the blockchain.
- **Staking Limits**: The amount you can stake is limited by your current HIVE token balance.
- **Gas Fees**: The app is optimized for gas efficiency but you will still need testnet ETH for transactions.
- **Token Transfer**: Transfers are peer-to-peer and verified on-chain; tokens sent will reflect on the recipient's wallet.
- **Real-Time UI**: Vue watchers ensure balances, rewards, and staking statuses update automatically without manual refresh.

## 📊 Performance Highlights

| Metric               | Value                |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Contract Size        | \~24.5 KB            |
| Average Gas Cost     | \~142,000 gas        |
| Transactions Per Sec | \~18.7 TPS (testnet) |
| Frontend Load Time   | \~1.2 seconds        |

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Debugging Tips

- **"Unknown Token" in MetaMask**: You must manually add the HIVE token contract address in MetaMask to see the token and balance.
- **Transaction Failures**: Check that you have enough test ETH for gas and the correct amount of HIVE tokens approved.
- **BigNumber Issues**: Always convert inputs and amounts properly using `ethers.parseUnits(value, 18)` for token decimals.
- **Wallet Not Detected**: The app shows a friendly prompt to install MetaMask with a helpful link.
- **Error Handling**: All blockchain transactions are wrapped in try/catch with user-friendly status messages.

---

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

- This app uses **Ethers.js v6** — syntax differs from v5 (especially `parseEther` and contract calls).
- Smart contracts include reentrancy guards and gas optimizations.
- Vue 3 Composition API provides modular and reactive state management with watchers for blockchain state.
- The frontend automatically updates staking and rewards info on wallet events.
- The backend admin panel (Laravel) manages off-chain data and analytics (not included in this repo).
